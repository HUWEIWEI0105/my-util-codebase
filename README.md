# my-util-codebase
The code base of my utility code. At least I find these code useful but they are not provided by some libraries, therefore I decide to write them by myself.

I try to minimize the dependencies as much as possible, so you can easily "copy & paste" them in your own project.

## CPP Code
1. **Record Number Counter**. A util counter to record the current count info and print a progress line automatically.

## Scala
1. **Akka-based Remote Logger Server**. A util to help debugging distributed programms.
